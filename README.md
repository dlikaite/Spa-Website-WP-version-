# Spa Website for Ausra Spa Namai (Wordpress version)

For the final project at Vilnius Coding School's Web Development Course I chose to create a Homepage for "Ausra Spa Namai" based on the design of template they have bought.

I used several plugins for the Wordpress version of this project:
- Advanced Custom Fields
- ACF Content Analysis for Yoast SEO
- Advanced Custom Fields: Post Type Selector arba Post Type Select Field for Advanced Custom Fields
- WP Migrate DB
- Yoast SEO
- Contact Form 7
- Intuitive Custom Post Order
- Regenerate Thumbnails
- Widget CSS Classes
- Advanced Custom Fields: Font Awesome Field
